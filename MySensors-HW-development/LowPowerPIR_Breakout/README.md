# Low Power PIR Breakout

Note: Deprecated, I will update it soon.


It is a small, slim, low power PIR Breakout board for evaluation on breadboard, or it can be integrated in small enclosure.

It is based on TI AN4368. Changes I made are :
- 2x potentiometer added
- debug points
- optional led on Out Signal (for debug)

Size : 24x19.7 (mm)
Components size 0805.

#### Pinout :
- VCC. Note : As it is designed for low power operation, it is not regulated. So 3.3V max.
- OUT : trigger signal output
- GND
