# $5 ESP8266 WiFi LED Dimmer
Custom hardware designs for a super tiny WiFi LED dimmer module based on the ESP8266, to control your lights from any device. __Doesn't need any arduinos or raspberries to work, just the ESP__. If you like this, please give it a star!

# Parts
After having ordered the print board, you're going to want to have these parts for every module (mind you, there's two panelized modules per board ordered!):
- 1x ESP8266, ESP-12 format
- 1x XM1584 Power converter (set to 3.3v!)
- 1x FDS8896 PowerTrench MOSFET
- 2x KF350-2P screw terminal blocks
- 4x 10k resistors, 0603 format

__Total cost: less than $5!__

I order most of it from China, sites like aliexpress.com will have them all.

# Order
Send all files in /gerber_files/5x5/ to your PCB house, and all should be fine and dandy!

# Having fun
Because this module is essentially a breakout for the ESP8266, you can use any firmware written for it.
I've written a bunch of cool things to get this module running as I want it to, check it out here: http://github.com/tjclement/esp-dimmer-software.

Just plug 12V and Ground from a power adapter in the IN terminal on the board, and connect your LED strip to the OUT terminal, and the ESP will be able to control the LEDs. Awesome!

If you're looking for something else (or write your own firmware), have a look at http://esp8266.com for more resources.

Serial communication can be done through the wire-to-board pads on the back of the board. I've broken out GPIO-0 there, and named it FLASH_EN. Just hook up TX to the RX of your serial adapter, RX -> TX, and GND -> GND. Keep FLASH_EN disconnected to enter the normal boot procedure during power on, or connect it to GND to enter flashing mode after turning the power off and on. You can use a loader like this one to load firmware onto the ESP: https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool.

# Modifying
You can open the .sch and .brd files in Eagle (V7.2+), and make any modifications you see fit. If you add something cool, please create a pull request so we can bring the awesomeness into the community!
