# Sensebender Micro

This is a micro sensor module for Mysensors project: http://www.mysensors.org

Designed to run on 2 x AA(A) batteries, depending on how often one would
like to replace the batteries. 

The sensor includes the following peripherals

- Si7021 Temperature / Humidity sensor (Connected to I2C bus)
- Jedec compatible eeprom/flash footprint
- ATSHA204A for authentication
- LED

The following pins are available on headers:

- Powersupply (1.8 -> 3.5V)
- SDA / SCL (I2C bus)
- A0 / A1
- D3 / D4 / D5 / D6 / D7
- 6 pin ISP port
- 8 pin standard NRF24L01+ connector layout
- FTDI header for serial

*Please note*

MAXIMUM allowed supply voltage is 3.5V, anything above this WILL fry both
Si7021, flash and NRF24 radio module. There is NO voltage regulator on board (To keep
supply current down to a minimum)
